== Welcome to Web-Admin

http://stillmaintained.com/rnhurt/web-admin.png

Web-Admin is a small, web based server administration application that allows
you to configure several key features.  These include the hostname, network
configuration, and mail server settings.  It was specifically built for use in 
KangarooBox application servers because we couldn't find anything like it on
the market today.  WebMin almost makes the grade but it is way to large and 
written in PHP.  :(  So we decided to write our own and put it out there for
everyone to see.
